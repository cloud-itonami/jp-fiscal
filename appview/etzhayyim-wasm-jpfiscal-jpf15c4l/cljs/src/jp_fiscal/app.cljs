  "jp-fiscal jpf15c4l (etzhayyim-project-jp-fiscal) Worker appview — reagent +
  re-frame, view built from jp-go-dds (デジタル庁デザインシステム) hiccup.

  Faithful port of the previous SvelteKit scaffold's status page
  (`appview/etzhayyim-wasm-jpfiscal-jpf15c4l/svelte/src/routes/+page.svelte`,
  84 lines): a static display of this Worker's own declared surface —
  title / project / kind, route count + list, wrangler var keys, an XRPC
  flag, and its own source path. Every field below mirrors the constant
  `app` object `+page.svelte` held in its <script> block, with the
  following deliberate changes (nothing here is invented beyond these, and
  nothing is simplified away):

  - `:app/relative-path` now names this file, not the deleted Svelte one.
    The old field also carried a stale `60-apps/etzhayyim-project-jp-fiscal/`
    prefix — drift from before this repo was extracted from `etzhayyim/root`
    (see `migration.edn` and README.md/CLAUDE.md, which already document
    that `60-apps/` does not exist in this repo). That prefix is dropped
    here since this field must name a file that actually exists in this
    repo.
  - `:app/xrpc?` is now false. This migration's
    `appview/etzhayyim-wasm-jpfiscal-jpf15c4l/wrangler.jsonc` drops `main`
    (see that file's header comment and the repo README): neither Worker
    source left in this repo calls `env.ASSETS.fetch` (`src/app.ts`, the
    real jp-fiscal ingest actor, and the moved
    `src/xrpc-mcp-router-proxy.ts`), so the XRPC BFF route this page used
    to advertise as enabled no longer deploys. The XRPC proxy handler
    itself is preserved byte-for-byte at
    `appview/etzhayyim-wasm-jpfiscal-jpf15c4l/src/xrpc-mcp-router-proxy.ts`
    (moved, not deleted, from
    `svelte/src/routes/xrpc/[...path]/+server.ts`) — backend Worker/XRPC
    code is out of scope for a frontend migration. Note the Svelte const
    itself said `xrpc: true` while also declaring `routeCount: 0` /
    `routes: []` — i.e. it was already inconsistent with its own
    wrangler.jsonc before this migration.
  - `:app/route-count` and `:app/routes`, and `:app/vars`, are NOT copied
    from the Svelte constant, which held `routeCount: 0`, `routes: []` and
    `vars: []` — stale relative to
    `appview/etzhayyim-wasm-jpfiscal-jpf15c4l/wrangler.jsonc`, which
    already declared two routes (`jpf15c4l.etzhayyim.com/*` and
    `jp-fiscal.etzhayyim.com/*`) and sixteen vars (`APP_ACTOR_HANDLE`,
    `APP_CAPABILITIES`, `APP_DEPLOY_AT`, `APP_DEPLOY_SHA`,
    `APP_DESCRIPTION`, `APP_DISPLAY_NAME`, `APP_EMBED_URL`,
    `APP_FRAMEWORK`, `APP_NANOID`, `APP_PERFORMER_TYPE`, `APP_SOURCE`,
    `APP_TEMPLATE`, `APP_UI_TYPE`, `APP_VERSION`, `INTERFACES_REQUIRES`,
    `AGENTGATEWAY_MCP_ROUTER_URL`). This namespace reports what
    `wrangler.jsonc` actually declares instead of repeating the page's
    pre-existing drift.

  `public/index.html`'s inlined <style> was produced once, at authoring
  time, by `jp-go-dds.page/->page` running on the JVM (via this deps.edn's
  jp-go-dds git/sha), concatenating the vendored `dds.css` with
  `jp-go-dds.core/ext-css` — exactly what `jp-go-dds.page/page` composes
  for its own <style> block. This namespace only requires
  `jp-go-dds.core` — the browser bundle does not need `jp-go-dds.page` or
  `html.core` at runtime; those are JVM-only tools used to author the
  static shell once. Regenerate that shell (e.g. if jp-go-dds's core
  components or ext-rules change) with:

    (require '[jp-go-dds.page :as page] '[clojure.java.io :as io])
    (spit \"public/index.html\"
          (page/->page {:title \"etzhayyim-project-jp-fiscal\"
                         :lang \"ja\"
                         :description \"Ai etzhayyim Jp Fiscal Worker appview (reagent + re-frame + jp-go-dds).\"
                         :css (slurp (io/resource \"jp_go_dds/dds.css\"))}
                        [:div {:id \"app\"} \"etzhayyim-project-jp-fiscal loading…\"]
                        [:script {:src \"js/app.js\"}]))

  (then add back the `<noscript>etzhayyim-project-jp-fiscal requires
  JavaScript.</noscript>` line the regen recipe above does not emit, same
  as open-ports's shell)."
  (:require [reagent.dom :as rdom]
            [re-frame.core :as rf]
            [jp-go-dds.core :as dds]))
